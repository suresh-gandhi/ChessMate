// Move encoding:
/// Bits 1-7 = move from index
/// Bits 8-14 = move to index
/// Bits 15,16 = promotion piece index (queen = 0, rook = 1, knight = 2, bishop = 3)

// Game state
/// Bit 1 = colour to move (white = 1; black = 0)
/// Bit 2,3,4,5 = castling rights (white kingside, white queenside; black kingside, black queenside)
/// Bit 6,7,8,9 = one-based en passant file (0 = no ep square, files are from 1 to 8)
/// Bit 10,11,12,13 = piece code of last captured piece
/// Bit 14 = move was ep capture (not implemented)
/// Bit 15 = move was promotion (not implemented)
/// Bit 16 = move was castles (not implemented)

// Known issues:
/// notation does not handle cases where both file and rank must be specified in order for move not to be ambiguous. For example in the following position:
/// rnb1kbnr/pppppppp/qqR5/q1q2NR1/qqR5/3P1N2/PPP1PPPP/1NBQKB1R w KQkq -
/// for the a6 queen to move to b5, the notation must be Qa6b5
